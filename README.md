# Android Malware Analysis using Static Features

## Overview

This project provides an analysis of Android malware using static features. We leverage Google Colab Notebook to perform static analysis on Android APK files, extracting relevant features and providing insights into potential malicious behavior. This README serves as a guide to set up and use the analysis notebook.
